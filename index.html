<h3> A little bit about myself:</h3>
	<ol> 
		<li>I love to eat cookies.</li>
		<li>I like writing stories, and playing with little kids.</li>
		<li>I love to ponder and think as to the creation of the universe. I study comparitive religion sometimes and connect science to religion. As Sir Francis Bacon once said,"a little understanding of science makes you an atheist, a deep understanding of science makes you a believer"
